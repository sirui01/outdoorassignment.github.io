<h2>Brief history</h2>
<p>Sungei buloh was first opened as a nature park in 1993. In 2002, 130 hectares of land were officially part of the Nature Reserve. In the same year, it was also recognised as a site of international importance for migratory birds. In 2003, Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve became Singapore's <em>first</em> ASEAN heritage park. <br>Since then, Sungei Buloh has expanded its land to include the mangrove ecosystem, mudflats, ponds and forests, providing a great sanctuary for many plants and animals!</br></p>
